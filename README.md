`WORDLIST.dic` contains a list of words I've encountered in scientific writing used to train spell-checkers.
This can be added as a custom dictionary in e.g. RStudio (Tools → Global options → Spelling).

It's set up to synchronize automatically with my [Atom settings](https://gist.github.com/ms609/b4fb9f3bf414261615dc1ba3ae76fd0a) – 
file an issue and I can set up the same process for your own settings file.

Contributions are welcome – [edit the list](https://github.com/smithlabdurham/dictionary/edit/main/WORDLIST.dic) and put in a pull request, or list proposed additions in an [issue](https://github.com/smithlabdurham/dictionary/issues).
